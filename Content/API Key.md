# Then next step is going to getting an api key for Mapbox's Geocoding Service

You should have already created an account with mapbox.com
* If you haven't done so already, do that now

Once you've done this step, go to: https://account.mapbox.com/access-tokens/

* On this page, you should see a "Default Public Token".  This will be the key we use to access Mapbox's geocoding service
	* If not click the "Create Token Button"
		* Give it a name, and leave all other default options checked.
		* Click "Create Token"
			* You may be prompted to enter your password

* Leave this webpage open, we'll refer back to it later.
